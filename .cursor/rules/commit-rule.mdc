# Commit Message Rules

All commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits specification in English.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

## Scope (Optional)

The scope should be the name of the package/component affected (e.g., `api`, `domain`, `infrastructure`, `application`).

## Subject

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (.) at the end
- Maximum 72 characters

## Body (Optional)

- Use imperative, present tense
- Provide additional context about the changes
- Explain the "what" and "why" vs. "how"
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

## Footer (Optional)

- Reference issue numbers: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

## Examples

```

- Create Address entity representing a location
